## About The Project
We're not just processing logs; we're embarking on a data expedition, uncovering patterns and insights with every step. This project is where efficiency meets excitement, and where data analysis gets a dose of dynamism!

## Built With
- **Spring Boot**: For backend robustness with a touch of elegance.
- **React**: Crafting a user interface that's as engaging as it is intuitive.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: The backbone of our containerized environment, ensuring consistency across the board.
- **Elasticsearch & ScyllaDB**: Our power duo for rapid searches and scalable storage.
- **Kafka & Redis**: The messengers and memory banks, key to keeping our data flow smooth.
- **PostgreSQL**: The old reliable for structured data storage.

## Why These Technologies?
- **Spring Boot**: Because we love springing into action with a reliable backend.
- **React**: Keeps our frontend reactive and interactive, just like a good conversation.
- **Docker**: For smooth sailing in deployment waters.
- **Elasticsearch & ScyllaDB**: Speed and scale are the names of the game.
- **Kafka & Redis**: Ensuring no message or data gets left behind.
- **PostgreSQL**: For when structured data is the order of the day.

## Architecture Overview
Dive into our system's architecture, where every component plays a critical role, much like a well-oiled machine or a perfectly synchronized orchestra.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Your adventurer's hat and a zest for data!
- Docker and Docker Compose, your trusty tools for this journey.
- JDK 17 and the latest React, because staying updated is key.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository - your first step into a larger world.
2. Run `docker-compose up` to bring the entire system to life.
3. Visit the designated ports to witness the magic in action.

## Usage

- **Query Interface**: Port 4000, your gateway to insightful data queries.
- **Frontend**: Port 5001, where beauty and functionality converge.

## Roadmap
- Expanding our feature set, always keeping the user in mind.
- Continuously refining performance, because better is always possible.
- Exploring new technological horizons, because curiosity drives progress.
